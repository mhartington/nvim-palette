# nvim-palette

Change easily nvim options at runtime without remembering their name !
nvim-palette will fuzzy-search the option depending on its description and help
you change it (automatic toggling of boolean options for instance).

# Installation

This is a remote plugin, it won't work in vim.

As dependancies, you need [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (to deal with csv) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf):
- python -mpip install --user pandas to install pandas 
- Installation in neovim with vim-plug:
```
Plug 'junegunn/fzf' " if not installed already 
Plug 'teto/nvim-palette', { 'do': 'UpdateRemotePlugins'}
```

Then run:
`:UpdateRemotePlugins`

# Configuration

Once installed, run the command `:Palette` to see the plugin in action.

See `:h palette` for more details.


# TODO

There are many ways to improve the plugin:
 - filter settings between scope (global/buffer/window)
 - add more entries
 	- List mappings and their descriptions (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6236)
	- Add menu entries (like those defined for gvim)
	- and their translations (in runtime/lang/menu_\* for instance. with gettext)


The entries of the plugin are currently parsed from options.csv, a file generated by some custom scripts parsing neovim's help and options.lua.
One of the objective is to make these scripts/information (setting description) 
	easier to get in general.

# Credits

To vim authors & the fantastic neovim community, very helpful and with great
vision.
